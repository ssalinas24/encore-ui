        <li>
          Many of the rxForm directives are designed for layout
          and positioning. However, there are some that are for stylistic
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>

    <h3>Labels and Inputs</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          You should remember that the rxFieldName isn't an HTML label element.
          <ul>
            <li>
              rxFieldName is a descriptive design element for a particular
              form field.
            </li>
            <li>An HTML label is used for accessibility.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You should use the <code>&lt;label for="formControlId"&gt;</code>
          format when defining your HTML labels.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <code>for</code> attribute connects the label to an
              appropriate form control. When the label is clicked, wherever it
              is placed in the DOM, it will focus or activate its
              corresponding form control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="msg-warn">
                DO NOT wrap the control within a label element.
              </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CSS does not have proper selectors to style label text based
                  on control state
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              You should place an HTML label around text in an appropriate
              rxFieldName element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inline HTML label elements should only be used with radios,
              checkboxes, and toggle switches.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Place the label
                  <strong>immediately after the form control</strong>.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      This enables you to style the label based on the state
                      of the control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      See <a href="#/components/rxCheckbox">rxCheckbox</a>,

          In contrast to its predecessor (rxFormItem), rxField and children
          provides you the flexibility to create form field inputs that make
          use of one or more controls.
          <ul>
            <li>See "Advanced Controls" in

    <h3>Error Messages</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inline Error messages should make use of the
          <a href="ngdocs/index.html#/api/rxForm.directive:rxInlineError">
            rxInlineError
          </a> directive.
        </li>
        <li>
          This directive is styled with bold and red text. It is not
          constrained by DOM hierarchy, so you may place it wherever it is
          necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Help Text</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>Help text should make use of the
          <a href="ngdocs/index.html#/api/rxForm.directive:rxHelpText">
            rxHelpText
          </a> directive.
        </li>
        <li>
          This directive is styled in a slightly smaller, italicized font and
          is not constrained by DOM hierarchy, so you can place it wherever it
          is necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reference the <a href="#/styleguide/buttons">links and buttons</a>
          section and the <a href="#/styleguide/layouts/3">Create Form</a>
          example for details about how to style and color buttons.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Submit buttons should use the green <code>.submit</code>
              class unless you are performing a destructive action, in which
              case, you should use the <code>.negative</code> class.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to use a button in your form field for auxiliary
          purposes, use the default blue.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="clear">Selects</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>For single item selection, use the
          <a href="#/components/rxSelect">rxSelect</a> component.
        </li>
        <li>
          For multi-item selection, use the rxMultiSelect element defined in
          the <a href="#/components/rxMultiSelect">rxMultiSelect</a>
          component.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="clear">Checkboxes</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the <a href="#/components/rxCheckbox">rxCheckbox</a> component
          for checkbox controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you intend to use a label element, place it <strong>immediately
          after the rxCheckbox</strong> to style the label when the control
          is disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="msg-warn">
            DO NOT wrap rxCheckbox in a label element.
          </strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="clear">Toggle Switches</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can use the
          <a href="#/components/rxToggleSwitch">rxToggleSwitch</a> component
          for toggle switch controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you intend to use a label element, place it <strong> immediately
          after the rxToggleSwitch</strong> to style the label when the
          control is disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="msg-warn">
            DO NOT wrap rxToggleSwitch in a label element.
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="msg-info">NOTE:</strong>
          An rxToggleSwitch does not toggle when clicking its label. However,
          CSS styles are still applied if the control is disabled within an
          rxForm.
        </li>
        <li>
          For consistency, and future compatibility, assume that rxToggleSwitch
          and label works as expected.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="clear">Radios</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <a href="#/components/rxRadio">rxRadio</a> component for
          radio controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you intend to use a label element, place it <strong>immediately
          after the rxRadio</strong> so that CSS rules may style the label when
          the control is disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="msg-warn">
            DO NOT wrap rxRadio in a label element.

    <h3>Using a Character Counter</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Character counters provide color feedback to the user in addition to
          numeric feedback. As a user approaches the character limit, the
          numeric value turns from gray to yellow, then yellow to red.
        </li>
        <li>
          The character counter is already styled and has the correct width
          needed to be positioned next to a textarea. If you need to change the
          textarea width, a custom wrapper class and textarea width can be set.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you intend to use a counter on text inputs, instead of the more
          commonly used text area, be aware the framework does not support
          these fields. You may experience unexpected results. Make sure to
          test your code.
        </li>
        <li>
          See <a href="#/components/rxCharacterCount/">rxCharacterCount</a> for
          more specific documentation about implementing a counter on a
          textarea or text input field.

    <h3>Disabled state</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          When an input is disabled, styles are automatically applied to
          gray out the field with a "not-allowed" pointer style.
        </li>
        <li>
          When label rules (seen above) are applied correctly to a radio,
          checkbox, or toggle switch, the label will also be styled.
        </li>

    <h3>Form Validation</h3>
    <div class="component-description">
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          EncoreUI is built on Angular and uses ngModel directives for
          validation. As a result, you will see custom CSS styling if an
          element has the <code>.ng-invalid</code> and/or
          <code>.ng-dirty</code> classes, which are dynamically added
          by ngModel validation logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some components will style based on both classes being present
          (typical use case), while others will only use
          <code>.ng-invalid</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating an EncoreUI-specific design pattern for placement of form
          validation messages is on our roadmap.
        </li>
        <li>
          At present, there are no styles for invalid toggle switches.

          Saving a form state can help with user experience. You can use
          rxAutoSave to activate this feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          rxAutoSave interacts exclusively with your model layer.
          Your UI/template code will be unaware that its state is being saved.

        </li>
        <li>
          The notification should only be shown after a change has been made
          to the form, not on page load.
        </li>
        <li>
          The subtitle of the page should indicate when the form was last saved
